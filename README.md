# SmartyKid

SmartyKid is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo. It's a fun and interactive game designed to help kids learn and practice their multiplication tables.

## Features

- Home Screen: The starting point of the application where the user can start the game.
- Game Screen: The main part of the application where the user plays the game.
- End Screen: Displays the user's score after the game ends.

## Installation

Before you can run SmartyKid, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed on your machine.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd <your-repo-directory>
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will open a new browser window with the Expo developer tools. You can then run the app on your device by scanning the QR code or on an emulator/simulator.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can navigate through the different screens:

- Home Screen: Press the "Start Game" button to start the game.
- Game Screen: Fill in the cells with the correct answers to the multiplication problems.
- End Screen: Your score will be displayed. You can press "Play Again" to start a new game.
